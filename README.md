# Titanic-Case-Study

The sinking of the Titanic in 1912, caused
by colliding with an iceberg, resulted in the
deaths of approximately 1502 passengers
and crew, making it one of the deadliest
commercial maritime disasters in history.
The tragedy led to the fact that some
individuals had a better chance of survival
than others was an eye-opening
observation. The objective of this study is to
apply data analytics (EDA) to find new
insights in the available dataset.
Furthermore, machine learning models
(Decision Tree and Logistic Regression) are
used to determine which types of individuals
were more likely to survive. The accuracy of
the different models is further compared and
analyzed to draw conclusions.
